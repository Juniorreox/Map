The app has support for GPX and KML files, as
well as the "geo URI scheme" and popular map
services (google-maps, openstreetmap, yandex, ...).

It can work offline (without Internet/WiFi) once
geodata has been downloaded and cached.

Other Android apps can use LocationMapViewer through an
Intent-interface.

Required Android Permissions:

* INTERNET: to download map data from Open Streetmap Server
* ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and ACCESS_WIFI_STATE: to find out if wifi/internet is online to start downloaded geodata
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (to cache downloaded map data in local file system and to load gpx/kml-Files to be displayed in the map)
* ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION: to display my own location in the map
